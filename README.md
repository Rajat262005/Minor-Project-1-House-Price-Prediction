# Minor-Project-2
# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model using the **California Housing dataset** from Scikit-learn. The goal is to predict median house values based on features such as location, income, and house characteristics.

---

## 📊 Dataset

We use the [California Housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html), which contains data collected from the 1990 California census.

### Features:
- MedInc: Median income in block group
- HouseAge: Median house age in block group
- AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
- AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
- Population: Block group population
- AveOccup: Average number of household members
- Latitude: Block group latitude
- Longitude: Block group longitude

### Target:
- Median house value in $100,000s
