## 📊 Dataset: California Housing

- Source: `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()`
- 8 Features (e.g., median income, house age, rooms, location)
- Target: Median house value in $100,000s

---

## ✅ Project Goals

- Load and explore the California Housing dataset
- Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices
- Evaluate the model using RMSE and R² metrics
- Visualize predictions and feature correlations

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation (Example Output)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE   | ~0.73 |
| R²     | ~0.61 |

> Note: Actual results may vary slightly depending on the data split.
